      <h1>2012 Toyota Prius C 100,000 Mile Review</h1>

      <h2> <b>My name is Steve and I drive a 2012 Prius C.</b> I bought this car new and have been driving it for the past 9 years living in Chicago and Minneapolis. It has been my daily commuter, grocery getter, roadtrip warrior, and occasional moving vehicle. I have put the car through it's paces so I wanted to give it a 100,000 mile review. </h2>

      <h2>The Good</h2>
      <h3>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius_C">2012 Toyota Prius C's</a> hybrid power train easily achieves fuel economy of better than 50 mpg. The connected Entune system gives access to online search, weather, and gas prices. The car's Eco Score screen encourages economical driving. I have been impressed with the car's reliability and fuel efficiency.</h3>

      <h2>The Bad</h2>
      <h3>The biggest criticism I have is the car's sluggish acceleration which can be a burden when entering freeways in heavy traffic. Also, the car's touch screen is prone to bad glare with a minimal amount of sunlight, and too many warning screens pop up when you try to use Entune.</h3>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <h3>Overall I have been happy with the car for years now. It is an excellent city car and daily driver that saves money on gas. It has been low-maintenance overall and I have not dealt with any battery issues. I have only had to do routine maintenance such as oil changes, fluids, air filter, and tires. One of the best things about the car is it is very easy to park.</h3>
